## Aviator Game Guide

The Aviator game is easy to learn but requires some strategy to maximize
your chances of winning. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you
understand how the game works.

### Understanding the Game

Aviator is a crash game, meaning that players need to place a bet before
the airplane \"crashes.\" The objective is to cash out before the plane
crashes to secure your winnings. The higher the plane flies, the more
your multiplier increases.

### How to Place a Bet

1.  Choose your bet amount before the round starts.
2.  Place your bet by clicking the "Bet" button.
3.  Watch the plane take off and monitor the multiplier.
4.  Cash out at any time to secure your winnings. If you wait too long
    and the plane crashes, you lose your bet.

### Tips for Winning

-   **Start Small**: Begin with smaller bets and increase as you get
    more comfortable with the game.
-   **Watch the Multiplier**: Pay close attention to the multiplier.
    Don't be too greedy---cash out before it crashes.
-   **Use Auto-Cashout**: Set a predetermined cash-out point using the
    auto-cashout feature, so you don't miss out on winnings.
